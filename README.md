# TinyLinks

This is a school midterm project to build a web app using Node. The app will allow users to shorten long URLs much like TinyURL.com and bit.ly do.

![Main Page](./asset/MainPage.png)

We have an HTTP Server that handles requests from the browser (client). Along the way I applied some advanced JavaScript and Node concepts, and more about Express.

File structure is a MVC.

## Project Outcome

This app is a simple multi-page app:

- with authentication protection
- that reacts appropriately to the user's logged-in state,
- and permits the user to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) a simple entity (e.g. blog posts, URL shortener).

## User Stories

_As an_ avid twitter poster,

_I want_ to be able to shorten links

_so that_ I can fit more non-link text in my tweets.

_As a_ twitter reader,

_I want_ to be able to visit sites via shortened links,

_so that_ I can read interesting content.

(Stretch) _As an_ avid twitter poster,

_I want_ to be able to see how many times my subscribers visit my links

_so that_ I can learn what content they like.

## What we used as a Project Requirements

- Express
- EJS
- FS module (read and write files)
- Cookie Session (encrypted cookies)
- Body Parser
- Bcrypt (password hashing)

### Site Header:

if a user is logged in, the header shows:

- the user's email
- a logout button which makes a POST request to /logout

if a user is not logged in, the header shows:

- a link to the login page (/login)
- a link to the registration page (/register)

## Route

### GET `/`

if user is logged in:

- redirect to /urls

if user is not logged in:

- redirect to /login

### GET `/urls`

if user is logged in:

- returns HTML with:
  - the site header (see Display Requirements above)
  - a list (or table) of URLs the user has created, each list item containing:
    - a short URL
    - the short URL's matching long URL
    - an edit button which makes a GET request to /urls/:id
    - a delete button which makes a POST request to /urls/:id/delete
    - (Stretch) the date the short URL was created
    - (Stretch) the number of times the short URL was visited
    - (Stretch) the number number of unique visits for the short URL
    - a link to "Create a New Short Link" which makes a GET request to /urls/new

if user is not logged in:

- returns HTML with a relevant error message

### GET `/urls/new`

if user is logged in:

- returns HTML with:
  - the site header 
  - a form which contains:
    - a text input field for the original (long) URL
    - a submit button which makes a POST request to /urls

if user is not logged in:

- redirects to the /login page

### GET `/urls/:id`

if user is logged in and owns the URL for the given ID:

- returns HTML with:
  - the site header (see Display Requirements above)
  - the short URL (for the given ID)
  - a form which contains:
    - the corresponding long URL
    - an update button which makes a POST request to /urls/:id
  - (Stretch) the date the short URL was created
  - (Stretch) the number of times the short URL was visited
  - (Stretch) the number of unique visits for the short URL

if a URL for the given ID does not exist:

- returns HTML with a relevant error message

if user is not logged in:

- returns HTML with a relevant error message

if user is logged it but does not own the URL with the given ID:

- returns HTML with a relevant error message

### GET `/urls/u/:id`

if URL for the given ID exists:

- redirects to the corresponding long URL

if URL for the given ID does not exist:

- returns HTML with a relevant error message

### POST `/urls`

if user is logged in:

- generates a short URL (random string with 6 alpha numeric characters), saves it, and associates it with the user
- updates the `urls.json` file
- redirects to `/urls/:id`, where :id matches the ID of the newly saved URL

if user is not logged in:

- returns HTML with a relevant error message

### POST `/urls/:id`

if user is logged in and owns the URL for the given ID:

- updates the URL
- updates `urls.json` file
- redirects to /urls

if user is not logged in:

- returns HTML with a relevant error message

if user is logged it but does not own the URL for the given ID:

- returns HTML with a relevant error message

### POST `/urls/:id/delete`

if user is logged in and owns the URL for the given ID:

- deletes the URL
- updates the `urls.json` file
- redirects to /urls

if user is not logged in:

- returns HTML with a relevant error message
  if user is logged it but does not own the URL for the given ID:

- returns HTML with a relevant error message

### GET `/login`


if user is logged in:

- redirects to /urls
  if user is not logged in:

- returns HTML with:
  - a form which contains:
  - input fields for email and password
  - submit button that makes a POST request to /login

### GET `/register`

if user is logged in:

- redirects to /urls

if user is not logged in:

- returns HTML with:
  - a form which contains:
  - input fields for email and password
  - a register button that makes a POST request to /register

### POST `/login`

![Login Page](./asset/Login.png)

if email and password params match an existing user:

- sets a cookie
- redirects to /urls

if email or password params don't match an existing user:

- returns HTML with a relevant error message

### POST `/register`

![Register Page](./asset/Register.png)
if email or password are empty:

- returns HTML with a relevant error message

if email already exists:

- returns HTML with a relevant error message

otherwise:

- creates a new user
- user id should be generated by `uuid` package (search how to use it)
- encrypts the new user's password with bcrypt
- updates the `users.json` file
- sets a cookie
- redirects to /urls

### POST `/logout`

- delete cookie
